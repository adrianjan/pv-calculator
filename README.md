# Pv calculator component

A simple component where the customer needed his own calculator and the ability to send the entire form to his email to automate the process of pricing photovoltaic installations.
A simple component in vue.js for one of my recent projects.

## Vue and Vuetify was used :)

## Features

- Form validation with watchers
- Form sending via emailjs 
- Shows energy demand based on your bill
- Error handling

In this small app I learnt how to read Vuejs and Vuetify documentation. I had fun while doing it!

## Tech

Things that made my writing easy and fast:

- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) - a cool and easy API for sending emails :)
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/) - a cool UI framework that helped me build it faster :)

## Installation

If you want to use my code just clone and have fun :)

```sh
git clone 
npm install
```
